I thought I would start a blog as I build out the project. My goal is to build a comprehensive, accessible, accurate and extensible baseball statistics database. It's useful to have a defined data structure to aim for, so I'm choosing career OpenWAR totals for each player. This is a simple model powered by a complex set of transformations. I wouldn't be surprised if I needed to build 100+ data models upstream of it.

One of the most difficult parts of calculating WAR is the difference in data coverage over the course of baseball history. Yesterday, I started to build out a coverage schema that will allow me to determine what statisitcs are possible to calculate for a given entity and granularity (e.g. player-fielding-career, pitching-game, team-season). Once I finish up a first draft of that, I'm going to go through the arXiv OpenWAR paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.7158.pdf) and start to map out the graph of transformations that will be required to calculate it.
