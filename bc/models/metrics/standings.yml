          most fundamental sabermetric concept because of how clearly it connects
          the process of scoring runs to the outcome of winning games. Ironically,
          'pythagorean' ended up applying much better as a descriptor of its centrality
          to the discipline than it did as a means of describing the formula itself,
          which has nothing to do with the Pythagorean theorem."
