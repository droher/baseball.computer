      Datasets from a hodgepodge of sources. To maintain a single source of truth,
      all data is sourced from Retrosheet play-by-play as much as possible.

        description: |
          A truncated version of Retrosheet's gamelog file. It includes only
          games prior to 1901 (for which box sores are generally not available).
          This is our only source of info for those games, so it does not conflict
          with any of the later data in the play-by-play.
