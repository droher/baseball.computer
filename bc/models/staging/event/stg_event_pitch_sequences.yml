    description: |
      Pitch-by-pitch sequence for events where we have
      pitch-level information. A pitch sequence includes ball/strike
      info, as well as items that are not themselves pitches, such as
      pickoff attempts and balls blocked in the dirt. Pitch data is
      very well populated from the 90s on, but is spotty before that.
      Presence of pitch data for one event does not guarantee that
      it will be present for other events in the same game.
      Non-pitch items have sporadic coverage, so their absence is
      not necessarily an indicator of real-world absence.
