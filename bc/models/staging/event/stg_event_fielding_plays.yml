      Each fielding play that occurs during an event,
      in the order in which it occured.

      Unless you have a specific interest in the order in which the plays occurred on an event,
      it is recommended that you use `calc_fielding_play_agg` table instead, as there are some quirks
      in the way that some metrics are calculated that require knowledge of other parts of the event (most 
      notably that a player can be credited with at most one assist on any given putout).
