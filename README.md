# baseball.computer
This is the library that powers the [baseball.computer](https://baseball.computer) database.

Starting from a set of Retrosheet files dropped off by the [Rust parser](https://github.com/droher/baseball.computer.rs), this library builds out a duckdb SQL database using [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core).

More info to come on development and usage, but for now check out the [database documentation](https://docs.baseball.computer).
