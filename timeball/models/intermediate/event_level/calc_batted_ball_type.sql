-- Contact type inference rules (only valid for batted balls without contact type)
-- 1. Putouts by outfielders are fly balls unless explcitly marked as shallow territory
-- 2. Putouts by infielders are pop flies (unassisted GB putouts should already be explicit grounders)
-- 2. Non-inside-the-park home runs are fly balls
-- 3. Balls fielded by infielders where there is anything other than
--    an unassisted putout are ground balls
-- 4. Any outs in foul territory are popups if caught by an infielder
--    and fly balls if caught by an outfielder
-- 5. If the location is explicitly recorded and specifies the outfield,
--    it is a fly ball, unless it is the shallow outfield, in which case
--    it is a popup
-- Many exceptions are possible, but they are some combination
-- of rare and likely to be explicitly noted when they do occur.
--
-- Location inference rules (applies to batted balls without location)
-- 1. Ground balls fielded by outfielders have infield depth
-- 2. All other depth/side cases are dictated by the fielder's position
--    via the `seed_batted_to_fielder_categories` table
-- 3. If there is no fielder, we go by the explicit location
-- (which is rarely available, especially when there is no fielder).
-- The explicit location data is better than the fielder data in a vacuum,
-- but fielder-based location is far more consistently available.
-- Choosing it as the default makes the data more precise (in the sense of self-consistent).
