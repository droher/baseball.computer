          Whether or not this game took place in a racially integrated league/season.
          This is defined as all AL/NL games from 1947 onward. Keep in mind that integration
          status has nuances that go well beyond the scope of this field: specifically,
          some teams had no Black players as late as 1958, and Black players were generally
          underrepresented until the early 70s, especially in the AL. See Mark Armour's research
          for more detail: https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-effects-of-integration-1947-1986/
