      These datasets are directly pulled from Retrosheet's box score files.
      Only games without original play-by-play accounts will have box score data;
      games with derived play-by-play accounts will have both box score and
      play-by-play data. In those dual-account games, box score data can still
      be useful for compiling fielding stats that cannot be directly attributed
      to a play.

      Unlike the play-by-play data, which is heavily parsed
      during data extraction, box score data is largely passed through
      without any enrichment or modification. Game-level metadata has the same shape
      as the game-level data from play-by-play games. Other tables come directly
      from a specific type of row in the box score file. These types
      can be divided into two groups:
      "lines", which roll up statistics to a player or team, and "events",
      which give more detailed information on notable plays.
