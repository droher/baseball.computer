    description: |
      Event-level info for each baserunner present at an event.
      This includes all baserunners present at the start of the event,
      as well as the batter if they end up active on the bases during the play.

        description: |
          The event ID that this baserunner is charged to,
          for the purpose of keeping tracked of inherited/bequeathed runners.
          The pitcher/catcher present at the charge_event_id are on the hook
          for the earned run. This doesn't necessarily remain constant
          throughout a baserunning apperance, as force-outs can change
          the inheritance of a particular runner.

        description: |
          For some games prior to the establishment of official inherited runner rules,
          a pitcher could be explicitly noted as the one charged with a runner. When
          this is present, it overrides the pitcher from `charge_event_id`.

      - name: attempted_advance_to_base
        description: |
          Populated for events where the runner attempts to advance to a base.
          In specific cases, this can be identical the initial base, such as when
          a runner is picked off or otherwise put out after trying to get back to the bag.
        data_type: base
      - name: baserunning_play_type
        description: |
          Populated for events that specifically have a baserunning play,
          as opposed to an advance on a batting play. Some plays apply to
          all runners present, while others apply to a specific runner.
          See `seed_baserunning_play_types` for more info.

          The bitwise representation of the runner's position:
          - 1st: 1 (001)
          - 2nd: 2 (010)
          - 3rd: 4 (100)
          
          This is a useful way to represent the runner's position
          because you can do a bitwise OR to get the full base state
          for the event.

      - name: is_advance_attempt
        description: |
          True if the runner attempted to advance on the play.
